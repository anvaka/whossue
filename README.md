Who’s Suing Whom In The Telecoms Trade?
---------------------------------------

This is visualization of force-directed layout and [vivagraph.js](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS). It's based on David McCandless & James Key work "[Who’s Suing Whom In The Telecoms Trade?](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/whos-suing-whom-in-the-telecoms-trade/)". I tried to mimic their style as close as possible, but still it's not perfect.

Another reason why this repository is here is this. It is the first time real world usage of [impy.js](https://github.com/anvaka/impy.js) - a developer friendly package manager without runtime. Take a look into the ```src``` folder and check how files are structured. Than compare it with the ```dist``` folder to see how ```impy``` had compiled it into the prod version.

To launch dev version of the code, simply run from the root repo folder:

```
python -mSimpleHTTPServer
```

and then open in the browser [http://localhost:8000/src/index.html](http://localhost:8000/src/index.html).
